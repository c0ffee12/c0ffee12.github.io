                            <p>Yey, first review post! Be gentle, it's my first time doing anything like this.
                                    So, onto this review:
                                </p>
                        <h1>Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso o Kasaneru</h1>
                        <h3>The Boy Who Cried Wolf Tells Another Lie Today</h3>
                        <img class="revimg" src="../images/mr1.jpg">

                        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the manga begins with our protagonist Keitarou Itsuki, a student in junior high who has a menacing glare
                            that he thinks is the reason for getting rejected mercilessly by the girl he likes, Aoi Tokujira.
                        </p>

                        <img class="revimg3" src="../images/mr3.jpg">

                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to "help" him out in
                            classic anime fashion, his expert crossdressing brother (who I totally thought was a girl until midway into the
                            series because I wasn't paying attention :D) gives him a makeover as to give him the appearance of a girl so that he can stop feeling bad.
                            Incidentally, he meets with and befriends
                            Tokujira who, unrecognizingly, explains that she isn't cold-hearted, but actually just has a fear of men. 
                            And, given Itsuki's sense of masculinity, Tokujira asks for her(his) help to fight her androphobia by means of competitive staring contest,
                            among other things.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no seriously. Among side characters include Botan Kurashiki (best ship btw), Tokujira's protector-type childhood friend who
                            suspects Itsuki of being a professional stalker (with good reason),
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Miyama, who unknowingly confesses to the very straight Itsuki.

                        <p class="sidenote">This is what you get for professional stalking.</p>

                        <p>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I would've wanted to see more of is
                                some backstory between Tokujira and her father, which is the main cause of her grief and androphobia. It seems as if he's just abusive for the convenience of
                                the plot, but I guess it wouldn't fit into the overall fluffy style that the series is going for if it was to go too in depth
                                into him. But it is a little awkward when the series concludes with "and that's how Tokujira overcame her androphobia.... but her father is still
                                abusive lol cya". But I'll totally forgive it because I got the ship I wanted, which I totally wasn't expecting!
                        </p>
